# neural-dependency-parser

This is a neural-network based dependency parser that maximizes performance on a given UAS (Unlabeled Attachment Score) metric. According to Stanford CS 224N, "A dependency parser analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between head words, and words which modify those heads. There are multiple types of dependency parsers, including transition-based parsers, graph-based parsers, and feature-based parsers." This implementation is a transition-based parser."
